title: NVVim v1.3.0
subtitle: Surprisingly not dead
---

The most visible thing in this release is the rename to nvvim to avoid the clash with the now actually popular neovim.

From an internal point of view, there has been quite a bit of rework, a move to support python 3 and handle modern (if unwise) dynamic loading in python.
