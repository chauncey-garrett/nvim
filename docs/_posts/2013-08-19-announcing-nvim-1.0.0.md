[Nvim][] is an clone of some of the main features of [Notational Velocity][nv] as a vim script.

NV/NValt remain one of the best arguments in favour of using OSX. A fast, efficient note-taking system that can be controlled entirely though the keyboard. 
Its combined search / title bar means you can just tell it what you want and you get the information you need or the ability to create a new note from the same command.
Unfortunately the codebase is too heavily dependant on OSX to make a port viable. 

Nvim is implemented as a vim script that is compatible with both vim and gvim, so it can be used in both as a gui app and in a terminal and on any platform that runs the requirements[^1]
