title: NVim v1.0.1
subtitle: First Bug edition
---

Well, they do say the easiest way to find a bug is to give code to customers...

## Fixes in this build:

* 11: os seperators resulted in nvim attempting to create new directories
  As a result of this change, *any* / or \ in a filename will get replaced with underscores[^1]
* 12: empty filenames were accepted (resulting in creating `.md`)


## Downloads

* [zip][]
* [tar.gz][]


[^1]: Both are replaced on all platforms to provide consistency when syncing files between OSes
